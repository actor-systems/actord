# The runtime and its guarantees

Actors stay native Durable Object classes that install `Lifecycle` and compose `actorRuntime(...)`. What it
guarantees, each backed by tests in workerd (see `examples/release-radar/tests/`):

| Guarantee | How |
| --- | --- |
| Refuses malformed, unauthorized-route, wrong-version, and invalid-payload messages | Envelope checks against `system.ts`; Standard Schema validation |
| Handles a message id at most once per actor | SQLite inbox, retained 7 days |
| A handler's writes, its outgoing messages, and its effect intents commit together or not at all | `ctx.storage.transaction()` around each handler |
| Delivers at least once, then dead-letters | SQLite outbox; alarm retries with backoff, up to 6 attempts |
| Never reports an unacknowledged external effect as delivered | Retries only with an idempotency key; otherwise `in_doubt` |
| A timer set by a handler is delivered once, after its delay, even across restarts; it is set only if the handler commits | `_actors_timers` row in the handler's transaction; derived id |
| A schedule that was missed while the object slept ticks once, then re-arms from now | Per-message due time in `_actors_meta`; the tick carries the missed time as `payload.at` and a derived id |
| A job is settled once, by its completion message, its probe, its deadline (in_doubt), or a cancel reported honestly | The outbox row waits as `awaiting_job` with its handle and deadline; `ctx.settleJob` and `ctx.cancelJob` act only on a waiting job; decision 0018 |

Not guaranteed: exactly-once external effects, global ordering, cross-actor transactions, or a route as a
security boundary. Effect usage is best effort: usage from an attempt that crashed the Durable Object is lost, and usage
reported after an attempt has timed out or ended is dropped. Decision 0007 has the details and the platform behavior they rest on.
